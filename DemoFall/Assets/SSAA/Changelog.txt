1.2
--------------

 - Fixed Screenshot Settings not saving when deselecting game object
 - Fixed HDR support
 - Fixed bug causing incompatibility with Post-Processing Stack
 - Better implementation of screenshot code.
 - Added "Ultra Quality (FSSAA)" mode to super sampling *
 - Added functionality to render supersampled panoramas (alpha) **
 - Added Adaptive Resolution Mode ***
 - Added global functions to control parameters of all the MadGoatSSAA instances in scene.
 - Added support for rendering to target render texture

*  FSSAA is inspired from the Filtering Approaces for Real-Time Anti-Aliasing slides by 
   Timothy Lottes (NVIDIA) and uses FXAA v3 to filter the render image before resizing  
   to screen resolution.

** Currently, Panorama Screenshots have color issues when supersampling (multiplier different than 1). 
   However it doesn't affect the operation of the other functionality of the asset and has been
   released as an "alpha" feature.

***Adaptshitive resolution mode works by keeping track of the framerate and adjusting the 
   render resolution in order to maximize the performance.

- Minor changes to the Editor UI

--------------
- Initial release
